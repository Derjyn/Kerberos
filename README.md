# Kerberos
Kerberos is currently a test lab for various functionality and features of rendering, physics, AI, etc.  
Eventually it will become a usable game engine.  If you ran the program now, it would present you with
a basic screen that changes color when you press spacebar, and exits when you hit escape.


### Roadmap  
* Develop "systems" classes (input, physics, sound, render, etc)
* Develop logging system
* Develop debugging system
* Implement GUI system (need to research options)
